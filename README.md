# No-Crystal-Anchor
One can't place End Crystals and Respawn Anchors in Overworld.
The main reason is of this plugin is to avoid TP Killing. Many servers have settings to disable pvp but players are vulnerable to Explosion Damage.

As End Crystals are required in End Dimension and Respawn Anchors in Nether Dimension, and most player activity is in Overworld so the mechanism only works on Overworld.
